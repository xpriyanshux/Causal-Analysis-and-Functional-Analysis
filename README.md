# Causal-Analysis-and-Functional-Analysis
Causal role of GM in diseases using two-sample MR. Publicly available GWAS datasets to identify IV. MR analyses TwoSampleMR framework. Causal SNPs were mapped to genes via eQTL. Functional enrichment and analysis. Validating via NLP were applied for semantic similarity analysis using, literature-driven contextual validation of enriched terms.
